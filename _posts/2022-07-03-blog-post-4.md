In this article, we are discussing deep image clustering, and more specifically, Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering (DEC). We are going to implement the DEC model while using a transfer model (VGG-16) to extract the features. We use the Pytorch library to implement the model and use the STL-10 dataset to train and test the performance of the clustering.
