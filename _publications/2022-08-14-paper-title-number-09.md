title: "Collective self-Understanding: A linguistic style analysis of naturally ocurring text data."
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Understanding what groups stand for is integral to a diverse array of social processes, ranging from understanding political conflicts to organisational behaviour to promoting public health behaviours. Traditionally, researchers rely on self-report methods such as interviews and surveys to assess groups’ collective self-understandings. Here, we demonstrate the value of using naturally occurring online textual data to map out the similarities and differences between real-world groups’ collective self-understandings. Specifically, we use machine learning algorithms to assess similarities between 15 diverse online groups’ linguistic style, and then use multidimensional scaling to map these diverse groups in 2-dimensonal space. We demonstrate there are five behaviourally distinct types of group - (a)vocational, political, ethnic/religious, stigmatised and relational – replicating the results of previous offline perceptual research and providing concurrent validity to the approach. Further, in Study 2, we find strong relationships between the co-ordinates of each group in multidimensional space and the values that the groups hold. Finally, in Study 3, we demonstrate how this approach can be used to track the development of groups’ collective self-understandings over time (N= 190,233). Using transgender Reddit data as our proof-of-concept example, we track the gradual politicisation and de-stigmatisation of the transgender group over the past decade. Further, the automaticity of this stylistic approach renders it advantageous for monitoring the development of various online groups simultaneously. This approach therefore has numerous implications for both governmental agencies as well as social researchers more generally. Future research avenues and applications are discussed in detail in the discussion.'
