title: "ASIA: Automated Social Identity Assessment using linguistic style"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'The various group and category memberships that we hold are at the heart of who we are. They have been shown to affect our
thoughts, emotions, behavior, and social relations in a variety of social contexts, and have more recently been linked to our mental
and physical well-being. Questions remain, however, over the dynamics between different group memberships and the ways in
which we cognitively and emotionally acquire these. In particular, current assessment methods are missing that can be applied to
naturally occurring data, such as online interactions, to better understand the dynamics and impact of group memberships in
naturalistic settings. To provide researchers with a method for assessing specific group memberships of interest, we have
developed ASIA (Automated Social Identity Assessment), an analytical protocol that uses linguistic style indicators in text to
infer which group membership is salient in a given moment'
