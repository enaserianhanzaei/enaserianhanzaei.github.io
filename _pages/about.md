I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Exeter’s Q-step Centre for Computational Social Sciences. Trained as a computer scientist/data scientist, I am passionate about problems at the intersection of data science and social science. My research goal is to better understand human behaviour and answer complex societal problems, by combining the power of computational methods with insights and theories from the social, behavioral, and political sciences.


As part of the <a href="https://www.norface.net/project/exid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExID project </a>, I am currently studying the far-right online communities to derive computational and large-scale data-driven insights, through language and visual imagery, and to develop mechanisms to identify how those far-right communities make some socio-political issues salient and construct particular collective identities. 

Before joining the ExID project, I was a social data scientist at the University of Exeter’s Psychology Department (CLES), where I integrated the computational methods with social psychology theories to develop models that detect and trace the social group membership in linguistic patterns using data from various sources <a href="https://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/identitrack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psy ID Lab</a>.
